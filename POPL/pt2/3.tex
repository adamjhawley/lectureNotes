\section{Atomicity}
A statement is atomic if it cannot be interfered with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Either executed completely or not at all
\end{itemize}

\section{Race Condition}
A race condition is where one process ``races'' ahead.
Processes that should be in sequence, should wait for others to complete, but do not.
This results in the output not being as expected.
This needs to be considered in concurrent programming design.

\section{Interleaving}
