\section{Pixels}
The pixel space is a rectangle on the $x,y$ plane, bounded by $0\le x\le x_{max}$ and $0\le y\le y_{max}$
Each axis is divided into an integer number of pixels, $N_x$ and $N_y$. The pixels therefore have width and height:
\begin{align*}
	W &= \frac{x_{max}}{N_x} \\
	H &= \frac{y_{max}}{N_y}
\end{align*}

Pixels are reffered to using integer coordinates, that either refer to the locatin of their left hand corners or their centres.
Knowing the $W$ and $H$ values allows the pixel to be defined.
Assuming that $W$ and $H$ are equal, the pixels are square.
